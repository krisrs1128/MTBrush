    MTBrush is an R package for testing and exploring a large collection of hypothesis. The package serves as an efficient tool to find out estimated effects and their relationships. It contains helper methods for supporting multiple hypotheses testing and methods for launching interactive interfaces. By brushing through histograms of statistics, users are able to link the highlighted intervals with scatterplots of the original data.
